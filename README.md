Cards Against Blockchain
========================

Cards Against Blockchain is based on Cards Against Cryptography, which described itself as "a party game for nerdy cryptographers".  Cards Against Blockchain is not quite as nerdy, but still has bit of an edge.  We are big fans of the blockchain community, and hope this game is played in a spirit of fun.  But if you don't like crude or offensive humor, this game may not be for you.
